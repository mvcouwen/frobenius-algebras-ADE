# frobenius-algebras-ADE

This repository contains Magma and Sage code that implements the algebras from [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02625](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02625).

We recommend the Sage version to anyone that would like to do computations with these algebras. The Magma code was mainly used to test hypotheses during the research that led to the article above.

Unfortunately, also the Sage version is only a very first working version of the code and many improvements can still be done. Especially the readability of the code can be further improved. Documentation is also missing. Therefore, if you would like to use this code, do not hesitate to contact me for further information.
